# Project Proposal

## Task

* TBD: https://canvas.emory.edu/courses/96729/assignments/554947

## Presentation

* Every team is expected to give a 15 mins presentation that may include discussions.
* Your presentation must be engaging and show a good summary of the written proposal.

## Proposal

Write up to 10 pages (excluding references) using [this template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ktprdzqxsndf):

* Header
  * Title: try to be as catch as possible.
  * Course ID and name.
  * List of team members.
* Abstract
  * Overview of the proposed project.
  * Intellectual merit.
  * Broader impact.
* Introduction
  * Objective: what you **want to** and **can** accomplish during this semester.
  * Motivation: what makes this research **valuable** to the world. 
  * Problem statement: be as **specific** as possible. For instance, "improving dependency parsing" is too ambiguous to be a research goal.  Instead, you want to write something like, "improving the accuracy of transition-based dependency parsing with selectional branching".
  * Your research goals must include some kind of **novelty**. State clearly that which part of your research is considered novel and give evidence by comparing your idea against previous work. 
* Background
  * Cite **related work** done by other researchers. For each work, include a brief description about the work, and how your work is distinguished from it.
  * If you have done **preliminary work**, specify what has been already done and what more will be done during this semester.
* Proposed Research
  * Be specific about your **methodologies**; it must be feasible within this semester. If you are planning to work more after this semester, specify the extended timeline in the following section.
  * Specify the **dataset** and **evaluation methods** for experiments. The proposal will be considered infeasible unless this part is convincing. 
* Timeline
  * Weekly plans of your research.
  * Specify who will do what in each timeline.
  * Do not forget to include times for writing the research paper and preparing for the final presentation.
